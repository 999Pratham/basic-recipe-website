        Creamy Mango Lassi is easy to make at home with a few simple ingredients. I love making this lassi, especially during summers when sweet mangoes are in season. If you enjoy having mango lassi at Indian restaurants, you would love this homemade version just as much! All you need is 10 minutes to make this!

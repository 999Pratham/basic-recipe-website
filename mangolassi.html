        Creamy Mango Lassi is easy to make at home with a few simple ingredients. I love making this lassi, especially during summers when sweet mangoes are in season. If you enjoy having mango lassi at Indian restaurants, you would love this homemade version just as much! All you need is 10 minutes to make this!

        Recipe:

    <h4>
        Ingredients:
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Mango puree:</strong>
        </li>
        <p>
            You can either use fresh or canned mango puree to make the lassi. I highly recommend using fresh sweet mango puree when mangoes are in season. Puree from Indian mangoes like kesar, alphonso, dasheri results in amazingly delicious mango lassi. But using canned is also okay, which you can find at any Indian grocery store.
        </p>
        <li>
            <strong>Yogurt:</strong>
        </li>
        <p>
            You can use yogurt of choice, I have used whole milk yogurt here but you can change it up according to your preference.
        </p>
        <li>
            <strong>Sweetener:</strong>
        </li>
        <p>
            I have used sugar to sweeten this lassi but feel free to use sweetener of choice. If you want, you can even skip the sweetener.
        </p>
        <li>
            <strong>Flavoring:</strong>
        </li>
        <p>
            The lassi is flavored with cardamom powder and a little bit of saffron at the end. You can skip the cardamom if you are not a fan. You can also add some rose water to the lassi if you like.

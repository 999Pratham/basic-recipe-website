        Procedure:
    </h4>
    <h5>For Cake:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 175°C (350°F). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add Wet Ingredients: Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients and beat with a hand mixer or whisk until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add Boiling Water: Carefully stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin, but that’s normal.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake: Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cool: Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and let them cool completely on a wire rack.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>For Froasting(Optional):</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix Cocoa Powder: In a medium bowl, stir together the cocoa powder and softened butter until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add Powdered Sugar and Milk: Gradually add the powdered sugar and milk, alternating between the two, and beat until the frosting is smooth and creamy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add Vanilla: Stir in the vanilla extract.
        </li>
        <li>
            Frost the Cake: Once the cakes are completely cooled, spread the frosting evenly over the top of one cake layer. Place the second layer on top and frost the entire cake.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your homemade chocolate cake!</p>
